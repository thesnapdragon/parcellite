parcellite
==========

This is a fork of the well known clipboard manager Parcellite.

Changes:
- Originally Parcellite only synchronizes system clipboards if both primary (simple selection) AND clipboard (CTRL+C) are enabled. I did not want to use simple selection method for copy, that's why I made this fork.
